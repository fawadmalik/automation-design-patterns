Navigate to the SUT homepage.
Click on the "Add to cart" button that adds a "Falcon 9" rocket product to the cart.
If it's your birthday you have the choice to apply a special discount coupon.
Before proceeding with further operations, we need to ensure that the loading indicator is not displayed.
Since we gto a discount, we have additional funding to buy additional rockets, so increase the quantity to 2 and click on the update cart button.
Once the cart is updated the test needs to check if the cart total price has been updated correctly.
If everything is OK, we click on the "Porceed to checkout" button.
Fill in all required information and click on the "Place order" button.
When the next page is loaded verify that the order was placed successfully.
